# Changelog

## 0.2.9

### Bugfixes

- Fixed accessors on AArch32; they were all broken because CRn and CRm were swapped.

## 0.2.8

### Bugfixes

- Made functions to write `AMEVCNTR0<n>` and `AMEVCNTR1<n>_EL0` safe.

## 0.2.7

### New features

- Added AMU registers.

## 0.2.6

### New features

- Added more GIC registers.
- Made some GIC registers safe to write.
- Added `with_*` methods to set fields taking `self` by value and returning it. This allows a less
  verbose builder pattern for register values.

### Bugfixes

- Fixed compilation error for output of `read_write_sysregs!` on AArch32 in some cases.

## 0.2.5

### New features

- Added SVCR register.
- Added TPIDR_EL3 register.
- Added Generic Timer registers.
- Added GIC registers.
- Added more fields to `MpamhcrEl2`.

## 0.2.4

### Bugfixes

- Fixed accessors for `ID_AA64SMFR0_EL1` and `TTBR1_EL2` raw encoding name in assembly, to avoid
  compilation errors when the assembler doesn't recognise the system register names.

## 0.2.3

### New features

- Added AMU feature detection for the `ID_AA64PFR0_EL1` register.
- Added FGT feature registers.
