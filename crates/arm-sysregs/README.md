# Armv8-A CPU system register access

Helper crate to access Arm A-profile CPU system registers.

## Implemented features

## Feature flags

The system registers for each Exception Level are guarded by a corresponding feature flag. Each EL
feature implies the lower ELs.

- `el3` gives access to all supported system registers.
- `el2` gives access to EL2, EL1 and EL0 system registers.
- `el1` gives access to EL1 and EL0 system registers.

Without any feature flags only EL0 system registers are included.

For unit testing, the `fakes` feature can be used. This replaces the assembly code for reading and
writing system registers with accesses to a set of fake system registers, stored in `fake::SYSREGS`.

## Future plans

## License

The project is MIT and Apache-2.0 dual licensed, see `LICENSE-Apache-2.0` and `LICENSE-MIT`.
